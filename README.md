# Howdy, Welcome To My Statistics Repository
These statistics repository contain my statistics learning journey using a [notebook file](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook) (the idea of combining computer code, explanatory text, images and more into the “notebook format”). Each of them will have their own branch and reference, so feel free to check them out!
